# KYC Document Automation: AI-Powered Serverless Pipeline

This project is a launchpad for production-ready automation of document-based workflows—such as KYC (Know Your Customer) document processing, support ticket summarization, log analytics, and other custom AI-powered data flows. It demonstrates how to combine AWS serverless services with foundation models on Amazon Bedrock for advanced content extraction, summarization, and classification.

## Project Vision

Build a scalable, observable, and cost-efficient serverless workflow that ingests uploaded documents (text, images, PDFs), invokes generative AI (Bedrock) for summarization/classification, and stores both raw and enriched metadata for analytics, compliance, or downstream automation.

## Objectives

- **Hands-on IaC:** Provision all infrastructure with reusable Terraform modules (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM, etc.), supporting automation, auditability, and repeatability.
- **Observability:** Implement CloudWatch logging, structured logs, and the foundation for custom metrics/alarms.
- **AI/ML Enrichment:** Use Amazon Bedrock LLMs to analyze, summarize, and classify KYC docs, tickets, or logs.
- **Extensibility:** Modular codebase designed for multi-region expansion (S3 cross-region replication, DynamoDB Global Tables).
- **CI/CD Readiness:** Ready for automated deployments via GitHub Actions, with policy for review, test, and safe promotion.
- **Cost-Efficiency:** Operate in the AWS Free Tier or with strict usage controls for Bedrock (test/demo volume only).
- **Production Blueprint:** Acts as a robust starting point for real-world document automation—KYC onboarding, compliance review, support intelligence, or log enrichment.

## Use Case Example

1. A customer uploads a scanned KYC document (PDF or image) or support ticket to an S3 bucket.
2. The upload triggers a Lambda function.
3. Lambda:
    - Reads the file.
    - Uses Amazon Bedrock for LLM-powered summarization/classification (e.g., “Extract name/address/date of birth from KYC”, or “Summarize this ticket’s main concern”).
    - Writes both extracted/summary fields and raw metadata to DynamoDB.
    - (Optional) Notifies compliance/ops teams if a document fails checks or needs review.
4. All activity is logged and observable in CloudWatch.

## Architecture

S3 (upload doc/ticket/image)
|
[Event]
|
Lambda (read, call Bedrock, parse/extract, write to DynamoDB)
|
DynamoDB (store raw + enriched results)
|
(Optional) SNS/EventBridge (alert/trigger workflow)


## AI/ML Integration

- **Text/Document Summarization:** Use Bedrock LLMs for high-quality, customizable summaries or key field extraction from uploaded documents.
- **Classification:** Auto-tag or classify support tickets, detect risk flags, or triage urgent requests.
- **Scanned Images:** (Optional extension) Integrate Textract for OCR before Bedrock summarization.

**Bedrock is pay-as-you-go. Use test/demo volume only and monitor billing for full cost control.**

## Getting Started

Step-by-step instructions for provisioning modules, integrating Bedrock, and running safe test uploads will follow in this repo.
